This is my Pokemon website. I have sorted out Pokemon indexes 001-099 by habitat (at least, I hope).

Unfortunately, I was unable to find the time to make the site a lot more interative or content-full. Integration with Pokemon APIs did not go so well either.
This also means that I had to enter all of the Pokemon information by hand, which is a lot of work, so I might have missed a few (the face that it may be incomplete makes it even more useless).

This is also my submission for "Rickroll Someone with your Favorite Tech", because hidden in here, in the dark depths of the page, is a link which Rickrolls you. See if you can find it!

Other than that, this is essentially a travel guide to the Kanto region of Pokemon, primarily by habitat. Its a fun little useless travel guide that I made for MLH INIT 2022.
In this project, I mainly wanted to try and test Bootstrap, because I had been using pure CSS to code so far, and after viewing the workshop where Bootstrap was first introduced to me, my eyes were opened. I would say that this project allowed me to really get an introduction to Bootstrap and what it can do.

Credits for my project:
https://wallpaperaccess.com/pokemon-scenery - All of my images for my carousel were found here and the creaters of these images have all credit. I take none in the making of these images. In the website it is stated that they are available to download for free.

https://github.com/JackBiggin/mlh-bootstrap-starter-kit - This repository is credited for providing a HTML/Bootstrap template to follow.

Also, I could not set up the Github pages in time. If you would like to see the execution of the code, you will have to download it. Huge apologies :(
